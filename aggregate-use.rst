Aggregate Usage
********************

ODK Aggregate can be used to collect data from ODK collect, filter the submitted data and export it to useful formats. It provides a mechanism for hosting the survey forms and gathering the survey results. 

When the URL to the ODK Aggregate server is first opened, you will be presented with the application page showing the :guilabel:`Submissions` and :guilabel:`Form Management` tabs. You will also see a :guilabel:`Log In` option and three help buttons.
